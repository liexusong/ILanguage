At present, comparisons only apply to numbers. I intend to impose an
ordering on all I operations (one that will, unfortunately, be
inconsistent for functions, because I can't possibly determine when two
functions are the same.
Each returns a boolean.

= Equality
< Less-than
> Greater-than

Less-than-or-equal-to and greater-than-or-equal-to will be defined at some
point, once I pick the letters. For now, you can use, e.g. <M= or 1-> for
<=.
