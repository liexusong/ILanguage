The following _logical_ data types are available to the programmer.
The relevant file is listed next to each one that is documented.

* Constants: applying as a function gives the constant back; attempting
  to map gives a domain error.
  * Errors
  * Numbers (arithmetic.md)
  * Characters
* Functions: mapping gives a fork (see forks.md).
  * Builtins
  * Names
  * Quasiquotes
* Collections: mapping applies to each contained element and returns the
  appropriate collection of results.
