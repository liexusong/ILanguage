This is the C source for an interpreter for the I language. The language is not fully specified as of this writing, so this source provides the current specification of I.

This document assumes familiarity with the basic functionality of I.

The goals of this implementation are as follows:
Simplicity. The source should be small, as well as modular and extensible.
Correctness. The source should be free of bugs and memory leaks.
Speed. Execution should be fast for canonical operations with known types.



The console is a simple REPL, implemented in main.c. Evaluation consists of several steps:


Input (main.c): a string is read from the console.


Scanning and parsing (parse.c, scan.c):

Verification (verify.c): The string is first verified for matching parentheses and quotes. If these are incorrect, an error is printed immediately.

Word formation, parsing, and evaluation take place concurrently. Each word goes through:
Word formation (scan.c):
The word type is determined by first letter. Then the word is scanned until it ends.
Parsing (parse.c):
The word is turned into an I value.
Execution (apply.c):
The word is applied to the stack.
