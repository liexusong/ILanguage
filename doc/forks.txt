A fork is a data structure defined by I, which has a function f
and a list of argument functions x.
When applied, f is applied to the list obtained by applying each
member of x to the arguments.

Since only one- and two- argument applications are supported, x
necessarily is of length one or two.

A fork is obtained by applying an operation to a function type
outside its domain.
