The following conventions will hold for all code in this source:

Names are either in camelCase or underscore-separated.
Variables have lowercase names.
Macros (including constants) have all-caps names, underscore-separated.
Typedefs have capitalized names. I types have single-letter names.
A lone value of a type will have the same name, but lowercase.

I types are always pointers.
type##v gives the dereferenced type.
I types which are structs will always be treated as pointers to structs,
and used with ->.

Memory for I arrays will always be allocated in powers of two.

Macros will be defined so they can be used with a trailing ;.
This does not mean, however, that they comprise a single statement.
