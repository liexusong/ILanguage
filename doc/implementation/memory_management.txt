Memory is handled with a reference counting scheme.
Complete handling rules are as follows:

For small values, i.e. those which cannot contain other objects,
the reference count will remain at one. These will be copied by
value in all situations.

Other values are initialized with a reference count of one.
When the value is assigned to a name or placed in a structure,
its reference count is incremented. "Deleting" such a variable
decrements its reference count, and kills it if that is zero.

When a value is passed to a function, it must be destroyed by
the function. del() may be explicitly called or the value may
be used in-place.
