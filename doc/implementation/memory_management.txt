Memory is handled with a reference counting scheme.
Complete handling rules are as follows:

For small values, i.e. those which cannot contain other objects,
the reference count will remain at one. These will be copied by
value in all situations.

Other values are initialized with a reference count of zero.
Once the value is assigned to a name or placed in a structure,
its reference count is incremented. "Deleting" such a variable
decrements its reference count, and kills it if that is zero.
Values with zero reference count will be appropriately deleted
or reused by functions applied to them if their reference
count is zero.
