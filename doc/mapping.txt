In addition to the implicit mapping provided by I (which should always be
your first plan of attack), there are several ways to specify your own
mapping.

D "domain"
uses r (which should return a boolean) to specify the domain for l.
If two arguments are given, r should return a list.

f "fmap"
lfr       maps r over l using the appropriate mapping.
l . r.f   does the same.
l g.f r   maps g over l and r using l's mapping type.

t "type"
l.t is the integer giving l's type.
